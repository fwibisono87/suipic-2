# Exclude e2e tests from unit test run
# Actually bun doesn't seem to have a simple 'exclude' array for test runner in toml yet (as of v1.1),
# but works via CLI. However, we'll try to use 'test match' patterns if possible or just rely on CLI args if toml fails.
# Exclude e2e by matching src only
testMatch = ["src/**/*.test.ts", "src/**/*.spec.ts"]

# Alternative: We can't rename e2e files. 
# We'll just ignore this for now and rely on the setup not crashing, OR user should run specific folder.
# But wait, the user ran `bun test` globally.

# Let's try to pass the folder explicitly in the command? No, user runs the command.
# I will try to rename the e2e files? No.
# I will hope that since bun-setup loads, e2e might fail fast or be ignored if I can specificy `src`?
